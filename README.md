# SE_LabExp_01---Basic-weather-Modeling
A Python-based simulation that demonstrates basic weather modeling using quadratic equations, developed in progressive stages. This educational project shows how quadratic solutions can represent simplified weather parameters such as temperature trends, pressure variations, or rainfall patterns over time or altitude.
Here’s a short **4-point features list** with emojis for your project:

---

### ✨ **Features**

* 🌦 **Weather Modeling** – Simulates temperature trends, pressure changes, and rainfall patterns using quadratic equations.
* 📂 **Flexible Input Handling** – Supports hardcoded values, keyboard input, and file-based single or multiple datasets.
* 🛡 **Robust & Beginner-Friendly** – Handles errors gracefully and helps beginners understand Python math and file I/O.
* 🧮 **Educational Focus** – Demonstrates step-by-step development of a quadratic solver for applied weather modeling.
