# SE_LabExp_01---Basic-weather-Modeling
A Python-based simulation that demonstrates basic weather modeling using quadratic equations, developed in progressive stages. This educational project shows how quadratic solutions can represent simplified weather parameters such as temperature trends, pressure variations, or rainfall patterns over time or altitude.
